# Community-Planner-Bootstrap

The bootstrap module of the GK community planner uses CouchDB [nano](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-nano).

It generates and populates a set of databases:

- users
- planner // todo
- events // todo
- messages // todo

## Folders

- index.js is the main
- db/ includes a methods file for each db
- views // todo


## Users

The database users includes all users registred to the community planner. 
Users are generated by using as baseline the user profile from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/).

The user generator forces the user location within a given area. 
It uses [turf random](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/tree/master/packages/turf-random) module to generate a random position within a bounding box.

User profiles are extended with:
- role, a single role from the list: gp, nurse, ward, social_worker, community_worker, neighbour
- skills, a set of skills from the list: cooking, driving, cleaning, running_errands, first_aid, nutrition, calling, gitness, counseling

Roles and skills are connected with. Skills are considered default for a set of roles.

The generator of users takes as parameter a distribution of roles (with a minimun number of units) and skills.

N.B. the code is written in ecma 2020, it requires node 10+ to run.
